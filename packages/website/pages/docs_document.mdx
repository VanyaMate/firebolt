# Document

The Document component is used to generate the outer shell of your app. All of your pages will be wrapped with this component.

```jsx title='components/Document.js' lineNumbers
import { css } from 'firebolt'

export function Document({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <head>
        <meta charSet='utf-8' />
        <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1' />
        <style
          global={css`
            :root {
              background: #ffffff;
            }
          `}
        />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

This is generally where you'll add your global styles, meta tags, favicons and fonts.

## Erm, wtf?

You might be wondering why this is so much simpler than other frameworks that require you to use custom `<Head>`, `<Meta>` and `<Router>` components. Thanks to new features in React we no longer need them! Firebolt and React bring us back to the times where web development was simple.
