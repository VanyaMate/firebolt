# Document

This is the root component of your app.

It should render the outer `<html>` shell that will wrap all of your pages.

```jsx title="components/Document.js" lineNumbers
export function Document({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <head>
        <meta charSet='utf-8' />
        <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1' />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

This is where you can set up any global things such as styles and fonts.
