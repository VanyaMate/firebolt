# Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your app to production you'll want to build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your app that can be started with:

```bash
npm run start
```

Check out our [Deploy to fly.io](/docs/guides/deploy-to-fly) guide for an example on how to Dockerize a Firebolt app and quickly deploy it to a production environment.
