# Introduction

Firebolt is a full featured React framework that will help you spend more time building your product and less time dealing with complexity.
It does this by providing a minimal set of well thought out features that can be used together to easily create websites, docs, blogs or apps for the web.

## It's just React

Firebolt stays within the realm of React without introducing too many complex, framework specific rules and conventions.
Most of your time will be spent creating regular React components and composing them together to form the hierarchy of your app.

Thanks to all of the new features in React 19, building web apps has become even more intuitive, and much like the official React docs, once you have a basic understanding of Firebolt you'll rarely need to come back to these docs again.

## Server Side Streaming

Firebolt takes full advantage of React server side streaming to ensure your app loads faster than ever before. Users will see the HTML for a page instantly, before any JavaScript runs.

When you need to load dynamic data you can reap all of the benefits of Suspense using [Loaders](/docs/loaders) anywhere you need. Parallel streaming provides the absolute fastest way to get dynamic content in front of your users.

In addition to this, server side streaming makes it easy to maintain good SEO and support for social sharing with OpenGraph and Twitter meta tags.

## Data Access

Firebolt introduces a new (simple) way to interact with databases and other sources of data directly inside any page or component with [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and [Actions](/docs/actions).
These features work seamlessly on both the server and client and take full advantage of Suspense.

You can create entire apps without writing a single API endpoint. For apps that still need to provide a public API to their users, we have [API Routes](/docs/api-routes).

## CSS-in-JS

Firebolt includes first-class support for CSS-in-JS that works out of the box with Server Side Rendering and Parallel Streaming.
While other frameworks include flaky support with complex workarounds, we offer best in class styling from the moment you create your project.

## Cookies

For code that runs on both the server and in the browser, cookies are the perfect fit. They're so useful that we decided to bake bi-directional synchronization of cookies into the framework. This means that when you update a cookie on the server, any UI observing that cookie will automatically update too.

## Markdown

If you're building documentation or a blog, it's much easier to write that content using markdown. Because of this, Firebolt boasts first class support for MDX pages with wrappers and custom elements.

## Summary

Firebolt is a "component first" framework which means that most (if not all) of your time will be spent creating and composing components that directly provide value to your users.

Each component can generate all of the HTML, Styles and Data that it needs with little to no external dependencies.

Building Firebolt apps is simple, fun and productive!
