# [api].js

**IMPORTANT:** Unless your app needs to provide a public API to its users, we recommend building your entire app using [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and [Actions](/docs/actions) instead of API routes.

Any `.js` file added to the `api` folder will become a publicly available API endpoint.

## Coming Soon

API Routes are currently work in progress. Stay tuned!!!!
