# Request

Both [Loader](/docs/ref/useLoader) and [Action](/docs/ref/useAction) functions receive a `Request` object as their first argument.

The Request object provides utilities such as cookie management and redirects, but more importantly you can decorate it with access to a database or anything else you might need. See [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) to learn more.

## expire(seconds)

_Available to Loader functions only._

By default data fetched from a Loader will be cached indenfinitely. For data that changes often you can set it to expire after a certain amount of time.

When data expires it becomes invalidated.

If any components are still observing this data it will be refetched in the background and automatically updated without triggering Suspense boundaries.

If no components are observing the data then the data is evicted immediately, causing the next read to trigger Suspense boundaries as if the data was never there to begin with.

```jsx
export async function getTickets(req) {
  const tickets = await req.db('tickets')
  req.expire(60) // data will become invalidated after 60 seconds
  return tickets
}
```

## redirect(url, type)

_Available to both Loader and Action functions._

Throws a redirect that will navigate the user to another page. The `type` argument can be `push` (default) or `replace`.

```jsx
req.redirect('/login', 'replace')
```

## error(data)

_Available to Loader functions only._

Throws an error that can be caught by an [\<ErrorBoundary\>](/docs/ref/error-boundary), decorating the error with an optional `data` prop that can be used to provide more context about operational errors.

## cookies.get(key)

Gets the value of a cookie.

```jsx
req.cookies.get('auth')
```

## cookies.set(key, value, options)

Sets the value of a cookie.

Any changes to cookies made on the server will automatically update any UI observing that value on the client.

```jsx
req.cookies.set('auth', auth)
```

Setting a cookie to `null` removes it.

```jsx
req.cookies.set('auth', null)
```

See the [useCookie](/docs/ref/useCookie) reference for more info about cookies.

## params

_Available to API Routes only._

An object with values for dynamic route segments and query parameters.
