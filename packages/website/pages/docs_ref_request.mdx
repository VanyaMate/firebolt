# Request

Both [Loader](/docs/ref/useLoader) and [Action](/docs/ref/useAction) functions receive a `Request` object as their first argument.

The Request object provides utilities such as cookie management and redirects, but more importantly you can decorate it with access to a database or anything else you might need. See [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) to learn more.

## .expire(seconds)

Can only be used in a Loader Function.

By default data fetched from a Loader will be cached until the user leaves or refreshes. For data that changes often you can set it to expire after a certain amount of time.

Once data expires it becomes invalidated. Any component observing that data will have it re-fetched in the background and automatically updated. No Suspense boundaries will be triggered.
If no components are observing the data then the next time the data is read will trigger the usual Suspense flow with loading UI etc.

```jsx
export async function getTickets(req) {
  const tickets = await req.db('tickets')
  req.expire(60) // data will become invalidated after 60 seconds
  return tickets
}
```

## .redirect(url, type)

Throws a redirect that will navigate the user to another page. The `type` argument can be `push` (default) or `replace`.

Can be used in both Loader and Action functions.

```jsx
req.redirect('/login', 'replace')
```

## .error(data)

Throws an error that can be caught by an [\<ErrorBoundary\>](/docs/ref/error-boundary), decorating the error with an optional `data` prop that can be used to provide more context about operational errors.

Can only be used in Loader function.

## .getCookie(key)

Gets the value of a cookie

```jsx
req.getCookie('auth')
```

## .setCookie(key, value, options)

Sets the value of a cookie.

Any changes to cookies made on the server will automatically update any UI on the client observing its value.

```jsx
req.setCookie('auth', auth)
```

Setting a cookie to `null` removes it.

```jsx
req.setCookie('auth', null) // remove cookie
```

See the [useCookie](/docs/ref/useCookie) reference for more info about cookies.
