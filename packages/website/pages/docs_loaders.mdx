# Loaders

Loaders let you fetch data securely from a database or anywhere else, directly inside your pages and components.

```jsx title='components/City.js' lineNumbers
import { useLoader } from 'firebolt'

export function City({ id }) {
  const city = useLoader(getCity, id).read()
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{city.name}</h1>
      <p>{city.description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export async function getCity(req, id) {
  return await req.db('cities').where({ id }).first()
}
```

Loaders simplify the way you build apps:

- Write business logic and access your database right alongside the components that use them.
- They're designed to work with both Suspense and [ErrorBoundaries](/docs/ref/error-boundary) the way React intended.
- Loaders work seamlessly via server streaming and on the client.
- Secure code is stripped completely from all client bundles.
- Forget about writing API endpoints completely (unless you [need them](/docs/ref/api-js))

## Requests & Invalidation

All loader functions are called with a [Request](/docs/ref/request) object that allows you to read/write cookies, perform redirects and set an expiration date on the data returned.
You can decorate the Request object with access your database etc in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config).

If you set data to expire or manually invalidate data it will be refetched in the background and seamelessly update the UI. Learn more on the [useLoader](/docs/ref/useLoader) and [useCache](/docs/ref/useCache) pages.
