# [page].js

Any `.js` file added to the `pages` directory is treated as a route in your app.

```jsx title='pages/index.js' lineNumbers
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>
}
```

The default export is used as the component when people visit the page.

## Route Matching

The filename you give a page determines how its route is matched:

| Page                          | Example URL                | Params                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pages/index.js`              | `/`                        | `{}`                                |
| `pages/dashboard_settings.js` | `/dashboard/settings`      | `{}`                                |
| `pages/blog_$postId.js`       | `/blog/123`                | `{ postId: "123" }`                 |
| `pages/cities_$tags+.js`      | `/cities/coastal/tech-hub` | `{ tags: ["coastal", "tech-hub"] }` |
| `pages/cities_$tags-.js`      | `/cities/coastal/tech-hub` | `{ tags: ["coastal", "tech-hub"] }` |
| `pages/cities_$tags-.js`      | `/cities`                  | `{ tags: [] }`                      |

The `_` symbol is used to nest paths. It's easier to see all of your pages at a glance when they're in a single folder, but as your app grows you can still nest pages in sub-folders if needed.

The `$` symbol is used to create dynamic route segments and its value(s) will be provided to you in the `params` object.

Adding a `+` suffix to a dynamic route segment will match one or more parameters, while the `-` symbol will match zero or more.

## Route Params

You can retrieve params for dynamic routes anywhere in your app with the [useLocation](/docs/useLocation) hook:

```jsx title='components/Post.js' lineNumbers
import { useLocation } from 'firebolt'

export function Post() {
  const { postId } = useLocation().params
  // ...
}
```
