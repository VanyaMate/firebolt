# MDX

Writing markdown makes it easier to create content based websites like blogs and documentation.

Firebolt has support for MDX pages by simply giving your page an `.mdx` extension instead of `.js`

```mdx title='pages/docs_quick-start.mdx' lineNumbers
# Quick Start

Lets get started...
```

## Wrappers

If your `.mdx` file has a default export, it will be used as a wrapper component which is useful for shared layouts:

```jsx title='components/DocsPage.js' lineNumbers
export function DocsPage({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>{/* links etc */}</nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  )
}
```

```mdx title='pages/docs_quick-start.mdx' lineNumbers
export { DocsPage as default } from '../components/DocsPage'

# Quick Start

Lets get started...
```

## Components

By default MDX will use basic elements such as `<h1>` and `<p>` but you can override these with a `components` export:

```jsx title='components/docs-components.js' lineNumbers
export const components = {
  h1(props) {
    return <h1 {...props} css='color:red' />
  },
}
```

```mdx title='pages/docs_quick-start.mdx' lineNumbers
export { components } from '../components/docs-components.js'

# Quick Start

Lets get started...
```

## Plugins

You can also enhance MDX with things like Syntax Highlighting and Github Flavored Markdown using Remark/Rehype plugins in your [Config](/docs/config) file.

```jsx title='firebolt.config.js' lineNumbers
import remarkGFM from 'remark-gfm'
import rehypeShiki from '@shikijs/rehype'

export default function config() {
  return {
    mdx: {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkGFM],
      rehypePlugins: [rehypeShiki],
    },
  }
}
```
