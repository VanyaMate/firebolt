# Styles

Firebolt includes it's own simple yet powerful CSS-in-JS that allows you to be productive immediately.

## Element Styles

You can style any element in your app using the `css` prop and the `css` tagged template literal:

```jsx title='components/Account.js' lineNumbers
import { css } from 'firebolt'
import { User } from 'lucide-react'

export function Account({ name }) {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        span {
          margin-left: 8px;
        }
      `}
    >
      <User />
      <span>{name}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You can also just use a string for doing quick styles:

```jsx
<div css='color:red;'>
```

Behind the scenes, Firebolt will auto-prefix your styles, insert them into the `<head>` and give your element a className to scope its styles.

## Global Styles

Global styles can be placed anywhere using a regular old `<style>` element. Global styles are useful for css-resets, themes and css-variables:

```jsx title='components/Document.js' lineNumbers
export function Document({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <style
          global={css`
            :root {
              --bg: #fff;
            }
            @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
              :root {
                --bg: #000;
              }
            }
            html {
              background: var(--bg);
            }
          `}
        />
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Why CSS-in-JS?

Firebolt ships with a ready to use CSS-in-JS implementation because of how well it works with a Component based architecture.

Paired with Firebolt [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and [Actions](/docs/actions) this makes building web apps extremely efficient and ridiculously simple.

Each part of your app can exist in a single component file that includes all the html, css and data access it needs. You can build entire apps using just the `pages` and `components` folders and most people don't even need to think about building an API.
