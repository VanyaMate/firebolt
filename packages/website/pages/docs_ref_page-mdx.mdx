# [page].mdx

Any `.mdx` file added to the `pages` directory is treated as an MDX route in your app.

```mdx title='pages/docs_intro.mdx' lineNumbers
# Intro

This is an intro page written using markdown.
```

## Wrappers

If your `.mdx` file has a default export, it will be used as a wrapper component. This is useful for shared layouts.

```jsx title='components/DocsPage.js' lineNumbers
export function DocsPage({ children }) {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        display: flex;
        nav {
          width: 400px;
        }
        main {
          flex: 1;
        }
      `}
    >
      <nav>{/* links etc */}</nav>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```mdx title='pages/docs_intro.mdx' lineNumbers
export { DocsPage as default } from '../components/DocsPage'

# Intro

This page is wrapped with the `DocsPage` component.
```

## Components

By default MDX will use default elements such as `<h1>` and `<p>` but you can override these with a `components` export.

```jsx title='components/docs-components.js' lineNumbers
export const components = {
  h1(props) {
    return <h1 {...props} css='color:blue' />
  },
}
```

```mdx title='pages/docs_intro.mdx' lineNumbers
export { components } from '../components/docs-components.js'

# Intro

The title of this page is blue!
```

This is useful for many things including applying syntax highlighting to code blocks or converting `<a>` tags to use `<Link>` instead.

## MDX Plugins

You can enhance MDX even more with plugins for Syntax Highlighting and Github Flavored Markdown etc using remark/rehype plugins in your [Config](/docs/ref/config) file.

```jsx title='firebolt.config.js' lineNumbers
import remarkGFM from 'remark-gfm'
import rehypeShiki from '@shikijs/rehype'

export default function config() {
  return {
    mdx: {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkGFM],
      rehypePlugins: [rehypeShiki],
    },
  }
}
```
