# Cache

All data from Loaders are collected in the cache which can be accessed with the `useCache` hook.

```jsx
import { useCache } from 'firebolt'

export function Component() {
  const cache = useCache()
  // ...
}
```

## Invalidation

If you used a Loader like this:

```jsx
const data = useData(getCitiesWithTags, 'tech-hub', 'night-life')
```

You can invalidate that data using this:

```jsx
cache.invalidate('tech-hub')
```

Or use a predicate function to filter through all cached data:

```jsx
cache.invalidate(args => args.includes('night-life'))
```

Any component observing data that becomes invalidated will be refetched in the background and automatically updated. No suspense boundaries will be triggered.

When no components are observing that data then the next time the data is read it will trigger the usual suspense flow with fallback UI.
