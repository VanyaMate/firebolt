# useAction

The `useAction` hook allows you to fetch data from an Action function written alongside any component. Action functions have access to server-only resources such as databases that you provide and their code is never exposed to the browser.

```jsx title='components/LikeButton.js' lineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useAction } from 'firebolt'

export function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)
  const exec = useAction(markLiked)
  const like = async () => {
    await exec(postId)
    setLiked(true)
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {!liked && <div onClick={like}>Like</div>}
      {liked && <div>You liked this post</div>}
    </div>
  )
}

export async function markLiked(req, postId) {
  await req.db('likes').insert({ postId })
}
```

The component above renders a Like button that when clicked, inserts data into the database and updates the UI.

## useAction(actionFn)

The first argument must be your Action function.

Returns a function that executes the action when called.

## Action Function

The action function must be exported from the same file or imported from another file.

The function is provided a [Request](/docs/ref/request) object as its first argument. The Request object has methods to access cookies and perform redirects.
You can decorate this object with access to a database or anything else in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) file.

Additional arguments from the action execution function are passed as additional arguments to your action function.

## exec(...args)

Calls your Action function with the provided arguments. Firebolt seamlessly handles calling your Action function on the server behind the scenes.

Returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the Action function.
