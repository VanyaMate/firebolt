# useAction

The `useAction` hook allows you to fetch data from an Action Function which is simply any function that you write alongside your component. Action Functions have access to server-only resources such as databases that you provide and their code is never exposed to the browser.

```jsx title='components/LikeButton.js' lineNumbers
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useAction } from 'firebolt'

export function LikeButton({ postId }) {
  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false)
  const exec = useAction(markLiked)
  const like = async () => {
    await exec(postId)
    setLiked(true)
  }
  return (
    <div>
      {!liked && <div onClick={like}>Like</div>}
      {liked && <div>You liked this post</div>}
    </div>
  )
}

export async function markLiked(req, postId) {
  await req.db('likes').insert({ postId })
}
```

The component above renders a `Like` button that when clicked, inserts data into the database.

## useAction(actionFn)

The first argument must be your Action Function.

Returns an action execution function.

## Action Function

The action function must be exported from the same file OR imported from somewhere else.

The first argument provided is a [Request](/docs/ref/request) object that provides utilities to access cookies and redirect users. You can also decorate the Request object with things such as access to your database, from your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) file.

## exec(...args)

Calls your Action Function with the provided arguments. Firebolt seamlessly handles calling your Action Function on the server behind the scenes.

Returns a promise that resolves with the return value of the Action Function.
