# Actions

Actions allow you to interact with your database or other server side code directly inside your components with the [useAction](/docs/ref/useAction) hook:

```jsx title='components/Subscribe.js' lineNumbers
import { useAction } from 'firebolt'

export function Subscribe() {
  const exec = useAction(subscribe)
  const submit = async form => {
    const email = form.get('email')
    await exec(email)
    console.log('Subscribed!')
  }
  return (
    <form action={submit}>
      <input name='email' />
      <button type='submit'>Subscribe</button>
    </form>
  )
}

export async function subscribe(req, email) {
  await req.db('subscribers').insert({
    id: req.uuid(),
    email,
  })
}
```

## Action Functions

Action functions are provided a [Request](/docs/ref/request) object that provides access to cookies and performing redirects.

You can decorate Request objects with access to your database or anything else you might need, in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) file.
