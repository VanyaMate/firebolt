# API Routes

You can build entire apps with Firebolt using just [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and [Actions](/docs/actions) and we recommend doing this for most apps built with Firebolt.

But, if your building a product or service where your users need to be able to interact with an API, you can use API Routes to do this.

## Coming Soon

API Routes are currently work in progress. Stay tuned!!!!
