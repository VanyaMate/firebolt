# useRoute

The `useRoute` hook provides details about the current route and methods to redirect users to another location.

## .url

The base URL including any hash and query parameters, eg `/blog/123?foo=bar#trains`.

## .pathname

The path of the current URL, eg `/blog/123`

## .hash

The hash of the current URL, eg `#trains`

## .params

An object that includes both search params and dynamic route segment values.

Given the page `routes/blog/$id.js` and the url `/blog/123?foo=bar`, the params object would look like this:

```js
{
  id: '123',
  foo: 'bar'
}
```

## .search(key, value)

Updates search params in the URL. Components will render again with the updated `params` object.

## .push(href)

Performs client-side navigation, adding the new route.

## .replace(href)

Performs client-side navigation, replacing the current route with the new route.

## .back()

Navigate to the previous route in the history.

## .forward()

Navigate to the next route in the history.
