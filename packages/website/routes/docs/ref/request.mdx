# Request

[Loaders](/docs/ref/useLoader), [Actions](/docs/ref/useAction) and [handlers](/docs/ref/handler-js) all receive a `Request` object that provides useful utilities including custom properties that you define (such as database access) in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config).

## cookies.get(key)

Gets the value of a cookie.

```jsx
req.cookies.get('auth')
```

## cookies.set(key, value, options)

Sets the value of a cookie.

```jsx
req.cookies.set('auth', auth)
```

Setting a cookie to `null` removes it.

```jsx
req.cookies.set('auth', null)
```

See the [useCookie](/docs/ref/useCookie) reference for more info about cookies and synchronization.

## expire(seconds)

_Restricted to: Loaders_

By default data fetched from a Loader is cached indefinitely. Use this to set the data to expire after a certain amount of time, or immediately.

When data expires it becomes invalidated. Any components still observing the data it will be refetched in the background and automatically updated without triggering Suspense boundaries. If no components are observing the data then the data is evicted, causing the next read to trigger Suspense boundaries as if the data was never there to begin with.

```jsx
export async function getTickets(req) {
  const tickets = await req.db('tickets')
  req.expire(60) // data will become invalidated after 60 seconds
  return tickets
}
```

## invalidate(...args)

_Restricted to: Actions_

Notifies the client to invalidate data matching the supplied `args`. Equivalent to calling `cache.invalidate(...args)` on the client.

## redirect(url, type)

_Restricted to: Actions, Loaders_

Throws a redirect that will navigate the user to another page. The `type` argument can be `push` (default) or `replace`.

```jsx
req.redirect('/login')
```

## error(data)

_Restricted to: Loaders_

Throws an error that can be caught by an [\<ErrorBoundary\>](/docs/ref/error-boundary), decorating the error with an optional `data` prop that can be used to provide more context about operational errors.

## params

_Restricted to: API Routes_

An object that includes search params and dynamic route segments.
