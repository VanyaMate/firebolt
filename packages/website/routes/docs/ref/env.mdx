# .env

Firebolt has built-in support for environment variables using `.env` files.

## Private Variables

All code that runs on the server such as server streaming including [handlers](/docs/ref/handler-js), [loaders](/docs/loaders) and [actions](/docs/actions) have full access to all environment variables through the `process.env` global, eg `process.env.DB_URI`.

## Public Variables

To use environment variables on the client, eg inside routes and components, environment variables must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_`, eg `process.env.PUBLIC_DSN`.

You can also change this prefix in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) file.

## Best Practice

- Create a `.env.example` file with good development defaults, and commit this to your repository
- Developers copy this file to `.env` and configure it as they need (this file is gitignored so that it isn't committed accidentally)

For more control you can also use `.env.development` and `.env.production` files. The former is used when running `npm run dev` and the latter is used when running `npm run build` and `npm run start`.
