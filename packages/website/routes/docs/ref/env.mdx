# .env

Firebolt has built-in support for environment variables including using `.env` files.

## Private Variables

All code that runs on the server such as server streaming including [handlers](/docs/ref/handler-js), [loaders](/docs/loaders) and [actions](/docs/actions) have full access to all environment variables through the `process.env` global, eg `process.env.DB_URI`.

## Public Variables

To use environment variables on the client, eg inside routes and components, environment variables must be prefixed with `PUBLIC_`, eg `process.env.PUBLIC_DSN`.

You can also change this prefix in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) file.
