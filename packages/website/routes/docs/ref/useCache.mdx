# useCache

The `useCache` hook lets you interact with the cache that stores [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and their data.

This hook returns the `cache` instance.

```jsx
import { useCache } from 'firebolt'

export function MyComponent() {
  const cache = useCache()
  // ...interact with the cache
}
```

## Cache Keys

All of the arguments that you pass in to the [useLoader](/docs/ref/useLoader) hook are combined to form a "cache key".

This cache key corresponds directly to its cached data and can be used to find, update or invalidate data at a later date, by matching some or all parts of a cache key.

## Tags

Because of how loader arguments and cache keys work, it can be useful to insert **additional** arguments to your `useLoader` calls that can be used as tags to categorize data.

```jsx
const loader = useLoader(getCities, id, '#cities')
```

In this example, the tag `#cities` is used purely to tag the data as city related, allowing you to easily update or refresh it at any point in the future.

## Invalidation Logic

Invalidating a loader will mark its data as stale.

If any components are still observing this data it will be refetched in the background and automatically updated without triggering Suspense boundaries.

If no components are observing the data then the data is evicted immediately, causing the next read to trigger Suspense boundaries as if the data was never there to begin with.

Note: data can also become invalidated if you use the `expire` method on the [Request](/docs/ref/request) object passed into your loader functions.

## .invalidate(...args)

Invalidates all loaders that use all `args` in their [useLoader](/docs/ref/useLoader) arguments.

If you used a Loader like this somewhere in your app:

```jsx
const loader = useLoader(getCitiesWithTags, 'tech-hub', 'night-life')
```

You can invalidate its data by calling

```jsx
cache.invalidate('tech-hub')
```

## .invalidate(predicateFn)

Invalidates loaders where the predicateFn returns true, for example:

```jsx
cache.invalidate(args => args.includes('night-life'))
```

## .find(...args)

Retrieves the first loader instance that uses all `args`, allowing you to invalidate or edit its data.

```jsx
const loader = cache.find(postId)
```

## .find(predicateFn)

Retrieves the first loader instance that matches a predicate, allowing you to invalidate or edit its data.

```jsx
const loader = cache.find(args => args.includes(postId))
```

## .findAll(...args)

Retrieves all loader instances that use `args`, allowing you to invalidate or edit their data.

```jsx
const loaders = cache.findAll(postId)
```

## .findAll(predicateFn)

Retrieves all loader instances that match the predicate, allowing you to invalidate or edit their data.

```jsx
const loaders = cache.findAll(args => args.includes(postId))
```
