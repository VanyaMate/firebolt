# handler.js

Any `.js` file in the `routes` directory that exports an HTTP method function will be treated as a handler.

This includes both virtual files and API routes.

## Virtual Files

You can use a handler to expose what appears to be a static file that is actually generated on the fly.

```jsx title='routes/sitemap.xml.js' lineNumbers
import getOrRefreshSitemap from '../scripts/sitemap.js'

export async function get(req, ctx) {
  const sitemap = await getOrRefreshSitemap()
  return new Response(sitemap, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/xml',
    },
  })
}
```

In this example, a sitemap is generated, cached and updated over time when the `/sitemap.xml` url is requested.

## API Routes

You can handle multiple HTTP methods to form API routes.

Supported function names are `get`, `put`, `patch`, `post`, `del` and `options`.

```jsx title='route/api/users/$id.js' lineNumbers
export async function get(req, ctx) {
  const { id } = req.params
  return await ctx.db('users').where({ id }).first()
}

export async function put(req, ctx) {
  const data = await req.json()
  /* update and return user */
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** Unless your app needs to provide a public API to its users, we recommend building your entire app using [Loaders](/docs/loaders) and [Actions](/docs/actions) instead of API routes due to how efficient they can be.

## Request & Context

Handlers are provided a Fetch API [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object with details about the request.

They're also given a [Context](/docs/ref/context) object that includes some utilities for managing cookies, route params, and any extras you've provided in your [firebolt.config.js](/docs/ref/config) such as database access.

## Response

Handlers can return any valid JSON and Firebolt will automatically respond with a `Content-Type: application/json` header and `200` status.

For more fine grained control, you can return a Fetch API [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) instance, allowing you to set different headers, statuses and body types.
