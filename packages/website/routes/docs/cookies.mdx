# Cookies

Firebolt makes it easier to work with cookies from anywhere in your app by ensuring they are kept to up to date.

If you modify a cookie on the server or from another component, any other components observing that cookie will update instantly.

```jsx title='components/Auth.js' lineNumbers
import { useCookie } from 'firebolt'

export function Auth() {
  const [token, setToken] = useCookie('authToken')
  return token ? <Profile /> : <LoginButton />
}
```

In this example, any changes to the `authToken` cookie (eg login/logout) will switch the auth component between showing the current users profile or showing a login button.

To learn more about cookies, check out the [useCookie](/docs/ref/useCookie) and [Request](/docs/ref/request) docs.
