# Cookies

Firebolt makes it easier to work with cookies by making them reactive from anywhere in your app.

If you modify a cookie on the server or in another component, any other components observing the cookie will instantly update.

```jsx title='components/AuthWidget.js' lineNumbers
import { useCookie } from 'firebolt'

export function AuthWidget() {
  const [token, setToken] = useCookie('authToken')
  return token ? <Profile /> : <LoginButton />
}
```

In this example, any changes to the `authToken` cookie (eg after logging in or out) will toggle the auth widget component between showing the current users profile or showing a login button.

To learn more about cookies, check out the [useCookie](/docs/ref/useCookie) and [Context](/docs/ref/context) docs.
